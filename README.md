# Hosting a Project in Localhost

First get your own api key by sign up in weatherapi.com and use it in fetch request.

To host a project in localhost, you need to follow these steps:
1. **Open Command Prompt (CMD)**: You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Windows search bar and clicking on the Command Prompt application.
2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to your project directory. For example, if your project is in a folder named "my-project" on your desktop, you would type `cd Desktop\my-project` and press Enter.
3. **Install Project Dependencies**: Run the `npm install` command in the Command Prompt. This command will install all the dependencies listed in your project's `package.json` file. Type `npm install` and press Enter.
4. **Start the Project**: After the installation is complete, you can start your project by running the `npm start` command. This command will start a development server and open your project in a web browser. Type `npm start` and press Enter.

Your project should now be hosted in localhost. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port if specified in your project).
